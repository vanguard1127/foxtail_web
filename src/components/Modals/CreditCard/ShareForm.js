      <p>
        Everyone with a Foxtail account has a personal invite code that you can
        share with friends interested in joining our sex-positive community.
        <br /> <br />
        You and your friend will receive 1 free week Black membership when they
        signup. You are only eligible for 1 week per individual, and there is no
        limit to how many you can earn (e.g. 52 friends = 1 year).
        <br /> <br />
        If your referral has already signed up for Foxtail before, you may not
        be eligible for this reward. <br /> <br />
        Ways to find and share your invite code:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click any share button, including social buttons, from within
            Foxtail. Share on any sites like Fet, Reddit, Facebook, etcâ€¦
          </li>
          <li>
            When a new member joins from one of your share links you will be
            notified.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please note: Black membership is activated once the member joins and
            cancels 1 week later unless you get more referrals.
          </li>
        </ul>
