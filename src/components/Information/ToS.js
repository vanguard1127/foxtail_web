      1. Preliminary Provisions:
      <br />
      1. Introduction - Welcome to our website's Terms and Conditions
      (hereinafter &quot;T&amp;C's&quot; of &quot;Agreement&quot;). The
      provisions of this Agreement will govern your use of our website, and you
      should therefore take some time to read it carefully. Our website is
      different from many other sites on the Internet as it contains
      advertisements, communications and links posted by independent third
      parties, over which we exert no control. We do not get involved in any
      disputes that may develop between our advertisers and others, and we do
      not facilitate communication between third parties. Therefore, you are
      urged to use your own good judgment and common sense when responding to
      such advertisements, as we are not responsible for any interactions
      occurring between our Users and our advertisers. Federal law protects
      sites like ours from civil claims, so we encourage you to independently
      research any information found in our Advertisements, before making any
      decisions. We hope that you thoroughly enjoy our services, and anticipate
      that you will find our site useful and informative. Should you have any
      questions or comments regarding our website, or its policies, please feel
      free to contact us at: support@foxtailapp.com.

      provider for www.foxtailapp.com and various other websites (collectively
      referred to as our &quot;Network&quot;). It should be obvious, but for the
      sake of legal clarity, when this Agreement uses first-person pronouns such
      as &quot;Us,&quot; &quot;We,&quot; &quot;Our,&quot; &quot;Ours,&quot;
      etc., those first-person pronouns are referring to LOV Corporation as the

    <br />

    <p>

    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      5. Our first condition is that you must agree to all of the conditions in
      this set of Terms and Conditions of use. You do not need to use our
      Website, therefore if you do not wish to be bound by each and every

      use the Website. We do not guarantee that such negotiations will be
      successful. Nevertheless, if You wish to discuss Your own personalized
      Agreement, please contact Us or have Your attorney do so.

      of the last revision to this Agreement. If the &quot;last modified&quot;
      date remains unchanged from the last time You reviewed this Agreement,
      then You may presume that nothing in the Agreement has been changed since
      the last time You read it. If the &quot;last modified&quot; date has
      changed, then You can be certain that something in the Agreement has been
      changed, and You agree that You will re-review the Agreement in its
      entirety and that You will agree to its terms or immediately cease use of
      any Websites in Our Network.

      3. Waiver - if You fail to re-review this Agreement as required to
      determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all responsibility
      for such omissions and You agree that such failure amounts to Your
      affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended terms. We are not
      responsible for Your neglect of Your legal rights.

      arising from the publication of third-party content (including third-party
      User content), appearing on the Website. We do not create such content,

      state laws including, but not limited to, the publication of material that
      might be considered defamatory, or violative of privacy or publicity
      rights. Note that federal law allows Us to remove any content found to be
      offensive, defamatory, obscene or otherwise violative of Our policies,
      without impacting Our status as a computer service provider. Nothing
      contained in this paragraph is intended to limit or alter the immunity
      from claims provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.{' '}

      direct damages exceed the total fees actually paid by You for use of a

      the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
      damages, the above limitation may not apply to You.

    <p>
      <br />
      10. Defamation Or Invasive Material Policy:
      <br />
      1. We provide an interactive computer service, and thus we have no
      liability for user-posted content due to Section 230 of the CDA.
      Nevertheless, We recognize that despite this protection, there may
      occasionally be content posted by Our Users that is unappreciated by the
      subject of the User-posted content. It is not Our intention to cause
      anguish to any person nor harm to any entity, nor to allow through
      inaction such harm to occur. Accordingly, it is Our policy to respond
      respectfully to any complaints about User posted content, or about content
      that We might have provided.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      2. If You feel damaged by any User-posted content, or content provided by
      Us, We agree to take reasonable measures to comply with any reasonable
      requests. Even if You are a public official, public figure, or libel-proof
      person, We do care about Your feelings and reputation. Therefore, We have
      instituted this Policy.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      3. You agree that if You have any complaint about any content on Our
      Website, including (but not limited to) a complaint or claim of defamation

      infringement, right of publicity claims, or any related or similar tort,
      that You will provide notice to Us by mail or fax to:

      You agree that We shall have ten (10) business days after RECEIPT of said
      notice to evaluate Your concerns.
      <br />
      1. After evaluating Your concerns, We will either inform You that We do
      not believe Your concern is valid, or We will request Your preference
      regarding an opportunity to cure Your concerns. This cure may include one
      of the following:
      <br />
      1. We may offer to delete the offending material.
      <br />
      2. We may offer to modify the offending material.
      <br />
      3. We may offer You the opportunity to publish a rebuttal to the offending
      material.
      <br />
      4. We will engage You and seek any other alternative resolution that will
      mitigate Your damaged legal interests - whether or not We are legally
      required to do so.
      <br />
      5. We may provide You with some or all identifying information We may have
      about the actual culprit (if the content was User-posted), but We are
      under no obligation to do so, and expressly reserve the right not to.
      <br />
      2. You acknowledge and agree that upon transmission of Your complaint to
      Us, You will be considered to have engaged in settlement discussions with
      Us, and neither party will initiate formal legal action while
      non-adversarial resolution is in progress. You agree that You will not
      file suit unless and until We issue a statement to You that We have taken
      Our final action, and that no further action will be taken without
      adversarial proceedings. At that point, You may proceed with arbitration
      as provided for under this Agreement.
      <br />
      3. You acknowledge that once You accept any of Our offers of non
      adversarial resolution, that You irrevocably waive any and all possible
      claims for any allegedly offending material on Our Website and that if You
      do bring any action against Us that You hereby stipulate that You will
      bear Your own costs and fees incurred in the action, regardless of the
      outcome of that action, and that You stipulate that Your damages will be
      limited to $1, and no more, and that You hereby acknowledge that such
      amount of $1 is sufficient and adequate.
      <br />
      4. You understand that no part of this Agreement obligates Us to go beyond
      that required by law, and this Agreement is in place for Your convenience.
      If We believe that Your requests are unreasonable, We reserve every right
      to terminate discussions with or file suit against You to recover any
      legal fees incurred due to harassing or unreasonable requests.
      <br />

      13. General Provisions
      <br />
      1. Governing Law. This Agreement and all matters arising out of, or
      otherwise relating to, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
      state of Florida, excluding its conflict of law provisions. The sum of
      this paragraph is that any and all disputes must be, without exception,
      brought to court and litigated in Orange County, Florida.
      <br />
      1. All parties to this Agreement agree that all actions or proceedings
      arising in connection with this Agreement or any services or business
      interactions between the parties that may be subject to this Agreement
      shall be tried and/or litigated exclusively in the state and federal
      courts located in Orange County, Florida.
      <br />
      2. The parties agree to exclusive jurisdiction in, and only in, Orange
      County, Florida.
      <br />
      3. The parties agree to exclusive venue in, and only in, Orange County,
      Florida.
      <br />
      4. The parties additionally agree that this choice of venue and forum is
      mandatory and not permissive in nature, thereby precluding any possibility
      of litigation between the parties with respect to, or arising out of, this
      Agreement in a jurisdiction other than that specified in this paragraph.
      <br />
      5. All parties hereby waive any right to assert the doctrine of forum non-
      conveniens or similar doctrines, or to object to venue with respect to any
      proceeding brought in accordance with this paragraph or with respect to
      any dispute under this Agreement whatsoever.
      <br />
      6. All parties stipulate that the state and federal courts located in
      Orange County, Florida shall have personal jurisdiction over them for the
      purpose of litigating any dispute, controversy, or proceeding arising out
      of (or related to) this Agreement and/or the relationship between the
      parties contemplated thereby.
      <br />
      7. Each party hereby authorizes and accepts service of process sufficient
      for personal jurisdiction in any action against it, as contemplated by
      this paragraph by registered or certified mail, Federal Express, proof of
      delivery or return receipt requested, to the parties address for the
      giving of notices as set forth in this Agreement.
      <br />
      8. Any final judgment rendered against a party in any action or proceeding
      shall be conclusive as to the subject of such final judgment and may be
      enforced in other jurisdictions in any manner provided by law if such
      enforcement becomes necessary.
      <br />
      2. Binding Arbitration. If there is a dispute between the parties arising
      out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement, the parties shall meet and
      negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve the dispute. If the parties
      are unable to resolve the dispute through direct negotiations, then,
      except as otherwise provided herein, either party may submit the issue to
      binding arbitration in accordance with the then-existing Commercial
      Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitral Claims
      shall include, but are not limited to, contract and tort claims of all
      kinds, and all claims based on any federal, state or local law, statute,
      or regulation, excepting only claims under applicable worker's
      compensation law, unemployment insurance claims, actions for injunctions,
      attachment, garnishment, and other equitable relief. The arbitration shall
      be conducted in Orange County, Florida, and conducted by a single
      arbitrator, knowledgeable in Internet and e-Commerce disputes. The
      arbitrator shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary
      damages; certify a class action; add any parties; vary or ignore the
      provisions of this Agreement; and shall be bound by governing and
      applicable law. The arbitrator shall render a written opinion setting
      forth all material facts and the basis of his or her decision within
      thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding. THE
      PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD
      TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.
      <br />
      3. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award any punitive or
      exemplary damages; certify a class action; add any parties; vary or ignore
      the provisions of this Agreement; and shall be bound by governing and
      applicable law. The arbitrator shall render a written opinion setting
      forth all material facts and the basis of his or her decision within
      thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding. THE
      PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD
      TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.
      <br />
      4. No Waiver of Right to Arbitration. There shall be no waiver of the
      right to arbitration unless such waiver is provided affirmatively and in
      writing by the waiving party to the other party. There shall be no implied
      waiver of this right to arbitration. No acts, including the filing of
      litigation, shall be construed as a waiver or a repudiation of the right
      to arbitrate.
      <br />
      5. The First Amendment Applies to Arbitration Proceedings. Any arbitration
      tribunal shall consider the First Amendment to the United States
      Constitution to be in force and effect between the parties. Both parties
      stipulate to the applicability of the First Amendment's protection of free
      speech, expression, and association, and both parties stipulate that case
      law interpreting the First Amendment shall be admissible and considered to
      be binding authority upon the Arbitrator.
      <br />
      6. Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an
      arbitrator finds any provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof,
      to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
      permissible and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full
      force and effect.
      <br />
      7. Attorneys' Fees. In the event any Party shall commence any claims,
      actions, formal legal action, or arbitration to interpret and/or enforce
      any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or relating in any way
      to this Agreement, including without limitation asserted breaches of
      representations and warranties, the prevailing party in any such action or
      proceeding shall be entitled to recover, in addition to all other
      available relief, its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
      connection therewith, including attorneys' fees incurred on appeal.

      telephone at 1-916-445-1254.
      <br />
      9. No Waiver. No waiver or action made by Us shall be deemed a waiver of
      any subsequent default of the same provision of this Agreement. If any
      term, clause or provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a
      court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the
      validity or operation of any other term, clause or provision and such
      invalid term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from this
      Agreement.
      <br />
      10. Headings. All headings are solely for the convenience of reference and

      between the parties with respect to Your access and use of the Website and
      the Materials contained therein, and Your Membership with the Website, and
      supersedes and replaces all prior understandings or agreements, written or
      oral, regarding such subject matter.
      <br />
      12. Other Jurisdictions. We make no representation that the Website or any
      of the Materials contained therein are appropriate or available for use in
      other locations, and access to them from territories where their content
      may be illegal or is otherwise prohibited. Those who choose to access the

      responsible for determining compliance with all applicable local laws.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <br />
      14. Stipulated liquidated damages
      <br />
      1. In various provisions in this Agreement, We have outlined liquidated
      damages amounts to be applied as penalties against You if You violate
      these specific provisions. You specifically agree to pay these amounts. In
      agreeing to pay liquidated damages, You acknowledge that this amount is
      not a penalty, that the actual damages are uncertain and difficult to
      ascertain, but that this amount represents the parties' good faith attempt
      to calculate an appropriate compensation based on anticipated actual
      damages.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <br />
      2. For any breach of a portion of this Agreement that does not
      specifically state a liquidated damages amount, You hereby agree that any
      breach of this Agreement shall result in liquidated damages of $5,000.00
      per occurrence. You specifically agree to pay this $5,000.00 in liquidated
      damages.
      <br />
      3. For any breach of this Agreement resulting in liquidated damages owed
      by You, You specifically agree and We expressly reserve the right to
      assign Our rights to these liquidated damages to a third party.
      <br />
      4. If We are required to enlist the assistance of an Attorney or other
      person to collect any liquidated damages or any other amount of money from
      You, or if We are required to seek the assistance of an Attorney to pursue
      injunctive relief against You, then You additionally agree that You will
      reimburse Us for all fees incurred in order to collect these liquidated
      damages or in order to seek injunctive relief from You. You understand
      that even a nominal amount of damages may require the expenditure of
      extensive legal fees, travel expenses, costs, and other amounts that may
      dwarf the liquidated damages themselves. You agree that You will pay all
      of these fees and costs.
    </p>
