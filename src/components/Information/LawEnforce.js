      <p>
        The operator of this website (hereinafter the “Site”) maintains
        operational policies protecting user privacy. These polices prohibit the
        disclosure of certain customer information without the customer’s
        express consent except as required to comply with a pending criminal
        investigation, a court order, search warrant, summons, discovery
        request, subpoena, or other legal process received by the Site, from a
        court of competent jurisdiction. If you require information regarding a
        customer or user of the Site, or other data in our possession, you must
        transmit a proper request to our Legal Representative set forth below.

        The Site will generally provide only such information as required or
        permitted by law. Pursuant to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
        18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., the Site is prohibited from providing the
        contents of stored emails or other electronic communications except
        under very limited circumstances. Generally a subpoena is required for
        basic subscriber information, however for other data, a court order or
        warrant is necessary. Please review applicable federal law before
