      <h1>ANTI-SPAM POLICY</h1>
      <p>for LOV Corporation</p>
      <p>NETWORK of WEBSITES</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        This website adopts the following Anti-Spam Policy, effective May 1,
        2019:
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>I. Preamble</p>
      <p>
        This Spam Policy pertains to all Websites owned or operated by LOV, Inc.
        (hereinafter “LOV”). LOV subscribes to a strict “No Spam” Policy as
        exhibited and explained by this Policy. LOV will not profit from, nor
        allow anyone else to profit from Spam of any kind. LOV will terminate
        any and all relationships with any entity producing illegal Spam, and
        LOV will cooperate with law enforcement to see to it that illegal
        spammers are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>A. Who should read and follow this Policy:</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        If you have any relationship, whatsoever, to LOV, you must, as a
        condition of a continued relationship with LOV read and familiarize
        yourself with this Policy and follow it in its entirety.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>B. Parties addressed in this Policy:</p>
      <p />
      <p>The Parties addressed in this Policy are:</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        1. LOV, d/b/a Foxtail, which may also be referred to as
        “Foxtailapp.com,” “COMPANY,” OR “We, Us, or Our.”
      </p>
      <p>
        2. All Affiliates or members of the Website(s), www.Foxtailapp.com,
        (“SITE”),
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Any other Affiliate(s), employee(s), contractor(s), servant(s), or
        agent(s) (“Affiliate” or “you/your”), of LOV. The existence of one of
        the aforementioned relationships to us neither creates nor implies the
        existence of another.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        II. ZERO TOLERANCE FOR UNSOLICITED E-MAIL or Other Terms of Bulk
        Communication
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        We consider any Dissemination of unsolicited commercial email (i.e.,
        “spam”) to be STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although federal law allows the dissemination of unsolicited bulk email
        under certain tightly regulated conditions, we have elected to impose a
        stricter, total spam ban policy, for all affiliates and promoters of
        this website. This means that Affiliates are prohibited from engaging in
        any bulk email promotions to disseminate their profiles or any other
        information about Foxtailapp.com, regardless of how the recipient email
        addresses are acquired, generated or obtained. This also means that use
        of opt-in, double opt-in, or any form of email address recipient list is
        likewise prohibited, regardless of whether such activities are otherwise
        permitted by state or federal law.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        Any violation of this strict Anti-Spam Policy will be grounds for
        immediate termination and forfeiture of all unpaid commissions or
        entitlement thereto. We reserve the right to audit and investigate
        compliance with the Anti-Spam Policy at any time, with or without
        notice.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        We are committed to stemming the flow of Spam that is prohibited by law.
        However, our commitment to eliminating Spam goes much further than what
        the law requires. Spam, in all its forms, is annoying and burdensome,
        and is inconsistent with our corporate policies. Consistent with this
        commitment and our policies, we prohibit types of Spam that have not yet
        been contemplated by the law, including:
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>A. Facebook Spam;</p>
      <p />
      <p>B. “Spim” or instant messenger Spam;</p>
      <p />
      <p>C. Spamming of internet newsgroups;</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        D. Spamming on Craigslist or other classified services, except in areas
        designated for
      </p>
      <p>such use;</p>
      <p />
      <p>E. use of any personals service to Spam other members; and</p>
      <p />
      <p>F. any other method of Spamming.</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        In short, if you are sending a message to a recipient who does not know
        you in some capacity, you may not send any information about us to them.
        If you are posting an ad somewhere that has our company information in
        it, that ad must be “on topic” and properly listed.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>III. INDEMNIFICATION</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        All affiliates, agents, employees or other promoters using any form of
        electronic commercial mail promotion in violation of this policy agree
        to indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all claims, charges,
        counts, debts, suits or other allegations arising from violations of the
        Act, or other applicable laws regulating transmission of commercial
        email. LOV shall provide immediate notice of any and all such claims,
        however the Site shall select its own attorneys to defend such claims,
        at the sole and exclusive expense of the affiliate, agent, employee or
        promoter responsible for the alleged violation.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>IV. AUDITS</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        You agree to cooperate in periodic audits of any of your activity taken
        without any right to advance notice. In the event we request it, you
        agree to make available to us, any and all promotional materials and
        communications used to market our services or your profile or any other
        matters relating to Foxtailapp.com within the last 2 years. You further
        agree to provide any information relating to such promotions, including
        but not limited to email addresses, lists, names, times & dates of
        transmission, IP addresses, servers, mail systems, software devices,
        compliance methods, and any other such information reasonable and
        necessary to conduct an audit of promotional activities. Failure to
        cooperate in such an audit shall constitute grounds for termination of
        our relationship, for cause.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>V. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        This Spam Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into your Affiliate
        Agreement. By continuing to avail oneself of the benefits and
        obligations of membership, all members thereby acknowledge the
        applicability and enforceability of these provisions as part of the
        existing Affiliate Agreement. By continuing to perform under the
        Affiliate Agreement, after receipt of notice of this Spam Policy, member
        thereby manifests his or her assent to these terms. All remaining terms
        contained in the Affiliate Agreement, not inconsistent herewith, shall
        remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>VI.</p>
      <p>
        A. Foxtail will immediately terminate any account which it believes, in
        its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any
        spam or other unsolicited bulk email. In addition, because damages are
        often difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably
        calculated then you agree to pay Foxtail liquidated damages of
        five-dollars ($5.00) for each piece of spam or unsolicited bulk email
        transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account, otherwise you
        agree to pay Foxtail’s actual damages, to the extent such actual damages
        can be reasonably calculated, unless otherwise specified in this
        Agreement or the Site’s Spam Policy.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>B. Stipulated Liquidated Damages</p>
      <p />
      <p>
        i. In various provisions in this Agreement, we have outlined liquidated
        damages amounts to be applied as penalties against You if You violate
        these specific provisions. You specifically agree to pay these amounts.
        In agreeing to pay liquidated damages, you acknowledge that this amount
        is not a penalty, that the actual damages are uncertain and difficult to
        ascertain, but that this amount represents the parties’ good faith
        attempt to calculate an appropriate compensation based on anticipated
        actual damages.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        ii. For any breach of a portion of this Agreement that does not
        specifically state a liquidated damages amount, You hereby agree that
        any breach of this Agreement shall result in liquidated damages of $500
        per occurrence. You specifically agree to pay this $500 in liquidated
        damages.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        iii. If We are required to enlist the assistance of an Attorney or other
        person to collect any liquidated damages or any other amount of money
        from You, or if We are required to seek the assistance of an Attorney to
        pursue injunctive relief against You, then You additionally agree that
        You will reimburse Us for all fees incurred in order to collect these
        liquidated damages or in order to seek injunctive relief from You. You
        understand that even a nominal amount of damages may require the
        expenditure of extensive legal fees, travel expenses, costs, and other
        amounts that may dwarf the liquidated damages themselves. You agree that
        You will pay all of these fees and costs.
