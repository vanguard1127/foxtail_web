      <h2>
        What potentially personally identifiable information do you collect?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When browsing Foxtail, we log the same basic information that most
        websites do. For each request, we collect your IP address, browser type,
        language preference, the referring page, the page you requested, and the
        date and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also track specific events for statistical purposes (like conversion
        rates and to test new designs).
      </p>
      <p>
        When you join Foxtail, we ask you to choose a nickname. If you would
        like to keep your Foxtail life separate from other parts of your life,
        we recommend you choose a distinct nickname to use on Foxtail that’s
        different from any nickname you may use elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also ask you for your email address, mobile number, and date of
        birth. We ask you for your email address so that we can send you updates
        and other essential information. We ask for a potential new member's
        mobile number so that we can verify them via text message login, which
        has resulted in improving the overall health of the community. And we
        ask for your date of birth to make sure you are of legal age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use cookies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and
        improve your experience on Foxtail. Unlike most other websites, we do
        not share any information about our members with third parties. Why?
        Because we respect your privacy!
      </p>
      <p>
        We send email notifications to the address associated with your account.
        You can update the email address associated with your profile, as well
        as review and customize which notifications you receive, at any time
        through our Settings page.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you write to Foxtail with a question or to ask for help, we’ll keep
        that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>The type of information collected is as follows:</p>

      <p>
        A. Username, Password, Email Address, and Gender/Sexual Information;
      </p>
      <p>B. Name, Age, Email Address, Mobile Telephone Number</p>
      <p>
        C. Age, Geographic Location, Hair Color, Eye Color, Body Shape, Race,
        Height, Self-Description, Gender and Other Information regarding Your
        sexuality and the sexual experience You are seeking or any other
        information You volunteer into Your profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        D.We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long
        as it makes sense
      </p>

      <h2>What information do we NOT collect?</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to support us, and we hope you do, any personally
        identifiable information you provide uniquely for this purpose will not
        be stored in any of our systems and will only be used to process the
        transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're under the age of 18, you may not join Foxtail. We do not
        knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 18, and if we
        learn that a member is underage, we will delete their account
        immediately.
      </p>
      <h2>How is the information shared?</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share, sell, rent, or trade members’ personal information with
        third parties for their commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do however sometimes share certain aggregated, non-personally
        identifying information with others about how the community collectively
        uses Foxtail. For example, we may compile statistics on how many daily,
        weekly, and monthly active members we have. However, we do not sell this
        information to advertisers or marketers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications
        Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such
        information;
      </p>

      <p>
        2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or
        bring legal action against someone who may be violating Our Acceptable
        Use Policy or other user policies;
      </p>

      <p>3. To operate Our Services properly;</p>

      <p>
        4. To protect Ourselves, Our Members, and the general public. We
        specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to
        law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or
        if We are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or
        administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders,
        writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the
        reasonable power to obtain such process.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party
        litigants, and others seeking information about Our end users to the
        extent required by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation may
        include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery
        requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of
        authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. If Foxtail is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t
        plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info
        about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
        policy.
      </p>
      <h2>How do you respond to legal requests for information?</h2>
      <p>
        Foxtail won’t hand your data over to anyone unless a court order says we
        have to. We reject requests from law enforcement when they seek data
        without a court order.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we’re going to share your information in response to legal process,
        we’ll give you notice so you can challenge it, unless we’re prohibited
        from doing so by law or court order.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will object to requests for information about members of our site
        that we believe to be improper.
      </p>
      <p>For more information, see Law Enforcement.</p>
      <h2>How is my information stored?</h2>
      <p>
        We use third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software,
        networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Foxtail.
      </p>
      <p>
        All data is written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and
        stored in more than one location.
      </p>
      <h2>How is my information secured?</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever your data is in transit between you and us, everything is
        encrypted and sent using HTTPS. Foxtail makes HTTPS mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than your password, data isn’t encrypted while it’s live in our
        database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it),
        but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.
      </p>
      <p>Our database backups are encrypted using GPG.</p>
      <h2>What is your data retention policy?</h2>
      <p>
        When you delete something from your profile, it will no longer be
        accessible by another member on the site, but depending on the content
        type, it will take up to 30 days for it to be permanently deleted from
        our database. If content is flagged and confirmed for a legal violation
        it may be held indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you request your account to be deleted, it's enqueued for seven
        days and then permanently deleted from our database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backups and web server logs are permanently deleted within 30 days of
        their creation.
      </p>
      <h2>How do you handle browser "Do Not Track" settings?</h2>
      <p>
        "Do Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if
        you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of
        information about your online activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not track your online browsing activity on other sites, and we do
        not permit third-party services to track your activity on Foxtail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we are not in the business of selling our friends (members) out,
        we don't believe we need to respond differently to an individual
        browser's "Do Not Track" setting.
      </p>
      <h2>How can I manage or delete information about me?</h2>
      <p>
        You can view and update your personal info at any time from your
        account's Settings screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can deactivate or delete your account at any time by logging into
        Foxtail and visiting the Settings page.
      </p>
      <h2>How do you notify people of changes to this policy?</h2>
      <p>To help our member stay current on this policy we send emails.</p>
      <h2>How do I contact Foxtail if I have any privacy questions?</h2>
      <p>
