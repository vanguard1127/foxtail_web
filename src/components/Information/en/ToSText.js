        Merchants who post links on Foxtail. The ability to include links is

      </p>
      <p>12. DISCLAIMER REGARDING THIRD PARTY CONTENT</p>
      <p>
        Foxtail offers access to numerous third party web pages and content
        available over the Internet. In overwhelming majority instances,
        including, but not limited to, sites contained within a directory of
        links, LOV has no control whatsoever over the content of such sites. In
        other instances, including, but not limited to, web pages hosted on
        Foxtail or provided to Foxtail by third parties, LOV may set guidelines
        for what may appear on such web pages and may engage in certain
        screening, but generally exercises no control over the content of such
        web pages and is unable to police all such content. Third party content
        accessible through Foxtail from such sources is developed by people over
        whom Foxtail exercises no control. Similarly, content hosted by Foxtail
        which is posted by third parties, and, with the exception of certain
        random screening functions, LOV cannot and does not screen such web
        pages before they are made accessible to other users of Foxtail.
        Accordingly, neither LOV nor its licensors assume any responsibility for
        the content of any site linked to the Foxtail web site or in any web
        page hosted for a third party within Foxtail web site. In instances
        where Foxtail does review the sites that are displayed in directories,
        indices, and/or references, or where Foxtail makes available
        directories, indices, and/or references of sites compiled by third
        parties, the content located at such sites was developed third parties,
        and review of such sites by LOV, if any, is narrowly limited to that
        which is necessary for compiling the particular set of links.
      </p>
      <p>13. STORAGE</p>
      <p>
        Many features of Foxtail store information on behalf of users. Examples
        include, but are not limited to chat, Profiles and postings. LOV Inc
        reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit the amount of
        storage space available per user or to delete materials stored for an
        excessive period while the user’s account has been inactive.
      </p>
      <p>14. ADVERTISERS AND CONTENT LINKED TO THE FOXTAIL NETWORK</p>
      <p>
        LOV and the Foxtail Companies may provide, or third parties may provide,
        links to other sites or resources located on the World Wide Web by
        allowing a user to leave Foxtail to access third-party material or by
        bringing the third party material into this site via "inverse"
        hyperlinks and framing technology. LOV have no control over such sites
        and resources. You acknowledge and agree that LOV are not responsible
        for the availability of such external sites or resources, and do not
        endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising,
        products, or other materials on or available from such sites or
        resources. You further acknowledge and agree that LOV shall not be
        responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
        caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or
        reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through
        any such site or resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in
        promotions of, advertisers found on or through the Foxtail Products and
        Services, including payment and delivery of related goods or services,
        and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations
        associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such
        advertiser. You agree that LOV shall not be responsible or liable for
        any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such
        dealings or as the result of the presence of such advertisers on the
        Product and Services.
      </p>
      <p>15. NO LICENSE; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF FOXTAIL AND OTHERS</p>
      <p>
        Except as expressly provided, nothing within any of the Products and
        Services shall be construed as conferring any license under any of LOV's
        or any third party's intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel,

        intellectual property laws. Upon receipt of notices complying or

        claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and may act
        expeditiously to remove or disable access to any reference or link to
        material or activity that is claimed to be infringing. LOV will
        terminate access for users who are repeat infringers.
